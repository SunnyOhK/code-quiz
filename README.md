# Heffalump Quiz

This application is a timed quiz putting players to the test on their Heffalump knowledge. "What is a 'heffalump'?" you might ask... Well, this is the name given to elephants by my favorite childhood character, "Winnie the Pooh." 


## Game Play
Players have 75 seconds to answer 6 elephant-themed multiple-choice questions. But BEWARE, each wrong answer takes 10 seconds off the clock. Final scores are based on the time remaining at the end of the quiz!

## Resources and Shout-Outs
- Alex Gonzalez (EdX tutor) - Alex was able to walk me through the most important "WHY" of JavaScript, instead of just telling me "HOW" to make a function work. From our tutoring sessions, I was able to navigate my way through the creation of this application with full understanding of the code I was writing.
